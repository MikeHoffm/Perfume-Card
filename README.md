## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries 

### What I learned

- This project was a good way to practice Flexbox. I became more comfortable with flex containers/flex items and how to position them.

- While attempting to make the card mobile friendly, I discovered and ended up using media queries. This was my first experience using them, and they seem to be very handy.

### Continued development

- I would like to practice more flexbox, as well as media queries in future small projects.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me a lot with use of flexbox. Plenty of visual examples, and a great resource for anyone struggling to understand the basics.
